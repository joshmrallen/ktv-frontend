# Backstory
Both collaborators have experience singing in Karaoke places abroad in China. The main different between Karaoke in East Asia and the US is the private room you get with your friends.

In addition, the music selection abroad is much more up to date on the latest pop songs in said country as well as almost every other country in the world.

Assuming it's a copyright issue, we decided to make our version of the Karaoke experience where we could get the songs we enjoy and match them with their lyrics so that they're in one place for us to sing and enjoy in front of our friends and family.
